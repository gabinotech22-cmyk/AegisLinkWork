Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using AegisLink. By installing or using the application, you agree to be bound by them.

## 1. Service Description

AegisLink is an end-to-end encrypted messaging application. It provides:

- Anonymous account creation without any personal identifiers
- Encrypted one-to-one and group messaging via the Double Ratchet protocol
- Encrypted voice and video calls over WebRTC (DTLS-SRTP)
- Ephemeral messages with user-configurable deletion timers
- Encrypted file attachments
- An optional enterprise tier ("AegisLink Work") with organizational features

AegisLink operates a relay server that forwards encrypted messages between clients. The relay never has access to plaintext message content. The relay is a transport layer, not a data processor.

---

## 2. Eligibility

You must be at least 13 years old to use AegisLink. If you are between 13 and 18 (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction), you must have parental or guardian consent. By using the app, you represent that you meet these requirements.

---

## 3. Account and Keys

Your AegisLink identity consists of a cryptographic key pair generated on your device. **You are solely responsible for maintaining access to your device and any backup passphrase you create.** We cannot recover your account, your messages, or your identity if you lose your keys. There is no password reset, no account recovery via email, and no support pathway to regain access to a lost identity.

You may delete your account at any time from within the application. Deletion is permanent and irreversible.

---

## 4. Acceptable Use

You agree not to use AegisLink to:

- Distribute, solicit, or store child sexual abuse material (CSAM) or any content that sexually exploits minors — this is a zero-tolerance policy and will be reported to relevant authorities to the extent technically possible given AegisLink's architecture
- Transmit malware, ransomware, or any software designed to damage or gain unauthorized access to systems
- Organize, coordinate, or carry out violence, terrorism, or any activity that threatens the physical safety of any person
- Violate applicable export control laws (including U.S. Export Administration Regulations and EU dual-use regulations) in connection with the cryptographic software
- Circumvent, reverse engineer, or attempt to compromise the relay server infrastructure, other users' encrypted sessions, or the application's security mechanisms
- Impersonate AegisLink, its operators, or other users in a way that deceives or defrauds

AegisLink's end-to-end encryption means we cannot proactively monitor message content. We rely on users to report abuse through the in-app reporting mechanism or by contacting aegislink.report@gmail.com. We will take appropriate action within the limits of what is technically possible.

---

## 5. Relay Service — No Warranty on Delivery

The AegisLink relay is provided on a **best-effort basis**. We do not guarantee:

- Message delivery within any particular time window
- Continuous or uninterrupted availability of the relay server
- Delivery of messages if the relay experiences downtime, migration, or denial-of-service events

Undelivered messages are held for a maximum of 30 days and then permanently deleted. Critical communications should not rely solely on AegisLink.

---

## 6. Encryption — No Warranty on Security

While AegisLink uses state-of-the-art cryptography and publishes its source code for audit, **no system is provably unbreakable**. We make no warranty that the encryption cannot be broken by a sufficiently resourced adversary, that vulnerabilities will not be discovered in the underlying libraries, or that your device itself is free of compromise. Security is a shared responsibility: you must keep your device and operating system up to date.

---

## 7. Disclaimer of Warranties

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, AEGISLINK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR UNINTERRUPTED OPERATION.

---

## 8. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AEGISLINK PROJECT, ITS CONTRIBUTORS, OR ITS OPERATORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF COMMUNICATIONS, OR LOSS OF PRIVACY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE AEGISLINK, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING UNDER THESE TERMS SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR AEGISLINK IN THE TWELVE MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM (IF ANY). IF YOU HAVE NOT MADE ANY PAYMENTS, OUR TOTAL LIABILITY IS ZERO.

Nothing in these Terms limits liability that cannot be excluded under mandatory applicable law (including consumer protection statutes in your jurisdiction).

---

## 9. AegisLink Work — Enterprise Terms

AegisLink Work is an optional enterprise tier that provides organizational features including managed workspace administration, role-based access controls, and audit tools for compliance purposes.

**Additional terms for AegisLink Work:**

- Enterprise subscriptions are governed by a separate Order Form and Enterprise Agreement. In the event of conflict, the Enterprise Agreement prevails.
- AegisLink Work administrators of an organization can manage membership and access within that organization's workspace. They cannot decrypt message content; the E2EE architecture is unchanged.
- Subscriptions are billed in accordance with the applicable Order Form. Refunds are subject to the terms in the Order Form.
- AegisLink Work does not alter the data practices described in the Privacy Policy. No message content becomes accessible to AegisLink as a result of using Work features.

---

## 10. Intellectual Property

The AegisLink application source code is released under an open-source license (see the repository for the specific license terms). The AegisLink name and logo are trademarks of the AegisLink project. You may not use them in a way that implies official endorsement or affiliation without written permission.

---

## 11. Changes to These Terms

We will post material changes to these Terms in the repository and update the effective date above. Your continued use of AegisLink after the effective date of updated Terms constitutes acceptance. If you do not agree to updated Terms, you should stop using the application and delete your account.

---

## 12. Termination

We reserve the right to suspend relay access for accounts that violate §4 (Acceptable Use), to the extent we are technically able to identify them. Because AegisLink does not log user IPs or communications metadata, such actions are limited in scope. We will not terminate accounts based on the content of encrypted messages we cannot read.

---

## 13. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

*[Governing law placeholder — to be updated before public launch with the jurisdiction in which the AegisLink project is legally established.]*

Any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of [arbitration body], except that either party may seek injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction for intellectual property or security matters.

Nothing in this clause prevents you from lodging a complaint with a supervisory authority if you are located in the European Economic Area or a jurisdiction with equivalent data protection rights.

---

## 14. Miscellaneous

- **Entire agreement:** These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any applicable Order Form, constitute the entire agreement between you and AegisLink regarding the service.
- **Severability:** If any provision is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in full force.
- **No waiver:** Failure to enforce any provision is not a waiver of our right to enforce it in the future.
- **Assignment:** You may not assign your rights under these Terms. We may assign ours in connection with a merger or acquisition, provided that your privacy rights under the Privacy Policy are not diminished.
