/**
 * Group roles & permission resolution — PURE policy module.
 *
 * Decides "what role does this member have" and "may this member do X" from a
 * group's signed governance state. Depends only on types — no stores, no DB, no
 * crypto — so it is trivially testable and import-cycle-free.
 *
 * IMPORTANT (security honesty): these checks are CLIENT-SIDE UX/policy gates.
 * The relay is zero-metadata and knows nothing about roles, so it cannot enforce
 * them. A modified/malicious client could bypass can() and emit, e.g., a
 * call:invite anyway. The real cryptographic boundary remains group membership
 * (SenderKey / session). Treat can() as "hide/disable the button for honest
 * clients", never as a security guarantee.
