 * legitimate return from the picker. Instead we wait for the 'active' event
 * (or use it immediately if we're already active), keep the flag up for one
 * extra tick so the lock handler still sees isPicking()=true, and fall back to
 * a hard timeout so the flag can never stick if no transition is observed.
