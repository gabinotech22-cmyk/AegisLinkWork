/**
 * Runtime integrity check — LOCAL ONLY, ZERO TELEMETRY.
 *
 * Uses jail-monkey to detect a hostile runtime (root/jailbreak, active hooking
 * such as Frida/Xposed, or an attached debugger). Deliberately chosen over a
 * RASP SDK that "phones home": AegisLink's ethos is user control + zero
 * metadata, so nothing here ever leaves the device.
 *
 * Response policy (NON-BLOCKING by design):
 *   - Never hard-block or crash — customized/rooted devices are the user's
 *     choice on a privacy app, and false positives must not lock anyone out.
 *   - Emulators are NOT treated as compromised (the team + store reviewers use
 *     them; jail-monkey's root check is false on a clean emulator anyway).
 *   - The only enforced consequence is refusing to upload an encrypted backup
 *     OFF a compromised device (root/hook) — keys must not leave a device where
 *     the Keystore can be dumped or the crypto can be hooked.
 *   - The UI surfaces a one-time local advisory; usage is never prevented.
