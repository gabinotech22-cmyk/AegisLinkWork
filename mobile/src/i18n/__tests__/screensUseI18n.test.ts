/**
 * Every screen must be wired to i18n.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * The 2026-08 audit found five screens — ProfileSwitcher, CreateProfile,
 * Scheduled, DistributionLists, BroadcastCompose — with no `useTranslation` at
 * all: roughly 41 hardcoded literals, and in mixed languages. A Spanish user got
 * every call error in English; an English user got the profile switcher and the
 * scheduled list in Spanish.
 *
 * The existing locale suites could not catch that. `i18nKeyParity` and
 * `localeParity` check that en/es/it hold the SAME KEYS — they say nothing about
 * whether a screen reaches for a key instead of typing a string. Three green
 * locale files next to five untranslated screens is exactly the kind of false
 * comfort worth removing.
 *
 * This is deliberately a coarse structural check, not a string linter: a screen
 * either imports the translation hook or it does not. Cheap, zero false
 * negatives for the failure mode that actually happened, and it fails the moment
 * someone adds a screen and forgets.
 *
 * A screen with genuinely no user-facing text can be added to ALLOWED_WITHOUT_I18N
 * below — with a reason, so the exemption is a decision and not a shrug.

// of a failed run showed the banner "Registro fallido" on an en_US emulator.
// That string lives in store/identity.ts, not in a screen — along with seven
// more in socket/groupCalls.ts, components/SchedulePicker.tsx and
// socket/client.ts. Alerts are the most user-visible text in the app and the
// easiest to hardcode, because they are written far from any JSX.
//
// So this walks ALL of src/ and fails on a themedAlert whose first argument is
// a bare string literal. A translated call passes t('…') / i18nT('…') /
// i18n.t('…'), never a quote.
